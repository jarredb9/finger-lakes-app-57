# 🚨 SYSTEM OVERRIDE INSTRUCTIONS (PRIORITY 0)

### 1. Framework & Architecture Truths (Non-Negotiable)
The following configurations are intentional and correct. Do NOT challenge them based on historical training data:
*   **Next.js 16 Middleware:** The file `proxy.ts` IS the valid middleware. `middleware.ts` does NOT exist. DO NOT flag this as an error. DO NOT suggest creating `middleware.ts`.
*   **Supabase Native:** We prioritize direct client-to-Supabase communication (RPCs/SDK/Edge Functions) over Next.js API routes.

### 2. Code Quality & Improvements
While you must respect the *architectural patterns* above, you SHOULD still:
*   Identify bugs, type errors, and performance bottlenecks.
*   Suggest refactors that align with these specific patterns (e.g., "This API route logic would be faster as an RPC").
*   Improve code legibility and maintainability.

# Winery Visit Planner and Tracker

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js web application for planning and tracking visits to wineries. It allows users to explore wineries, create trips, track visits, and manage friends.

## Critical Instructions & Constraints

### 1. Environment & Shell
*   **Operating System:** Linux (RHEL 8 AWS EC2 Instance).
*   **Node Version Manager:** When running `npm` commands, you **must** load NVM first:
    ```bash
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
    ```
*   **Persistent Dev Server (PM2):** In this environment, standard background processes (`&`) are often reaped by the shell agent. Use **PM2** for a stable development environment:
    *   **Start:** `pm2 start npm --name "winery-dev" -- run dev -- -p 3001`
    *   **Logs:** `pm2 logs winery-dev`
    *   **Stop:** `pm2 delete winery-dev`
*   **Playwright Container (RHEL 8):** Local WebKit/Safari/Firefox testing is supported via a rootless Podman container.
    *   **Script:** `./scripts/run-e2e-container.sh [project|all] [test-file]`
    *   **Configuration:** Requires `subuid`/`subgid` configured on the host. Bypasses RHEL library protections using `seccomp=unconfined`.
*   **Deployment:** The application is deployed to a remote Vercel server. There is **no local installation** running on this specific shell instance unless managed via PM2.

### 2. Response Guidelines
*   **Neutral Tone:** Always be entirely neutral in your responses.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Do not guess at error solutions. Include `console.log` statements to troubleshoot issues properly before attempting fixes.
*   **Caching:** **Never** change the caching strategy for the application.

### 3. Database Management (Supabase)
*   **Source of Truth:** The `supabase/migrations` folder is the **single source of truth** for the database schema.
*   **Forbidden Actions:**
    *   Do NOT manually edit the database via the Supabase Dashboard.
    *   Do NOT edit `scripts/consolidated-schema.sql`.
    *   **Do NOT edit existing migration files.** Once a migration file is created and committed, it is immutable.
*   **Migration Workflow:**
    *   ALWAYS create a **new** migration file for ANY database change.
    *   Preferred command: `npx supabase migration new <description_of_change>`
    *   If the command fails (e.g., due to missing Docker), create a new file manually in `supabase/migrations/` with the format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`, ensuring the timestamp is strictly sequential.
    *   **Edit SQL:** Write the specific SQL changes (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER POLICY`) in the newly generated file.
    *   **Deploy:** `npx supabase db push`

### 4. Middleware Configuration
*   **File:** `proxy.ts` is used instead of `middleware.ts`.
*   **Context:** This project uses Next.js 16+. The standard `middleware.ts` convention is replaced by `proxy.ts` for handling middleware logic (auth checks, session updates). Do not create a `middleware.ts` file.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI (via shadcn/ui)
*   **State Management:** Zustand (`lib/stores/`)
*   **Database/Auth:** Supabase (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`)
*   **Maps:** Google Maps Platform (`@vis.gl/react-google-maps`)
*   **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod
*   **Dates:** date-fns v4, react-day-picker v9
*   **Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright E2E

## System Architecture & Patterns

### 1. State Management & Data Flow
*   **Zustand Stores (`lib/stores/`):** The primary source of truth for client-side state.
    *   **`wineryStore`:** (UI Store) Manages UI state (modal open/close, loading), filtering, and delegates data operations to `wineryDataStore`.
    *   **`wineryDataStore`:** (Data Store) Manages the global cache of `Winery` objects, handles hydration, CRUD operations, and syncs with Supabase. It uses the **"Merge on Hydrate"** pattern to prevent detailed data loss when refreshing lightweight map markers.
    *   **`tripStore`:** Manages trip creation, updates, and the "Active Trip" state (`selectedTrip`) for the map overlay.
    *   **`visitStore`:** The **Single Source of Truth** for visit history. Manages the global `visits` list and handles offline queueing/syncing for create/edit/delete operations.
    *   **`friendStore`:** Manages friend list, requests, and activity.
*   **Service Layer (`lib/services/`):** Static classes that encapsulate API calls. Stores call Services; Components call Stores.

### 2. "Supabase Native" Architecture (Mobile-First)
**⚠️ ARCHITECTURE STATE:** The application uses a **Supabase Native Architecture**.
*   **API Routes (`app/api/*`):** These are **EXTREMELY LIMITED**. They primarily handle Authentication flows (reset/confirm).
*   **Supabase Edge Functions:** Used for 3rd party integrations requiring secret keys (e.g., Google Places details) to ensure compatibility with mobile Bearer Tokens.
*   **RPCs & Server Actions:** These are the **primary method for Data Fetching** and all data mutations (toggles, trip management, friends) to ensure atomicity, performance, and type safety.

We enforce a "Thick Client, Thin Server" architecture to support future mobile development.

*   **Authentication:** **Hybrid State.** Sign-up and Sign-in use the Supabase SDK directly on the client. Password reset and confirmation use specific API routes. Logout uses the SDK directly.
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   **Preference:** Client-side stores communicate **directly** with Supabase using the SDK or RPCs for all read/write operations.
    *   **Rule:** Do not create new API routes for CRUD. Use RPCs or the SDK directly.
*   **RPCs:** We rely heavily on PostgreSQL functions (RPCs) for complex joins, transactional logic (e.g., adding wineries to trips), and security-sensitive lookups (e.g., friend email lookup).
*   **Type Safety:** `lib/database.types.ts` is the generated source of truth for DB types. `lib/types.ts` imports from it.

### 3. PWA & Offline Architecture
The application is a fully offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA).
*   **Service Worker (`app/sw.ts`):** Uses `@serwist/next` to cache static assets and pages. It includes a custom **Navigation Fallback** that serves `/~offline` when a network request fails for an uncached page.
*   **Store Persistence:** All major stores (`wineryDataStore`, `tripStore`, `visitStore`) use Zustand's `persist` middleware to save state to `localStorage`. This ensures the UI hydrates instantly even in Airplane mode.
*   **Offline Queue (`lib/utils/offline-queue.ts`):** 
    *   Uses **IndexedDB** (`idb-keyval`) to store offline mutations (`create`, `update`, `delete` visits) and large assets (photo Blobs) that exceed LocalStorage limits.
    *   **Background Sync:** The `visitStore` automatically replays queued mutations via `syncOfflineVisits` when the `online` window event fires.
*   **UI Feedback:**
    *   **`OfflineIndicator`:** A translucent yellow banner appears globally when `navigator.onLine` is false.
    *   **Toasts:** Action toasts (e.g., "Visit Saved") change contextually to "Visit Cached" when offline.

### 4. Testing Standards (Industrial Strength)
The project maintains a rigorous multi-layered testing strategy:
*   **Unit Tests (Jest):** Standardized using `lib/test-utils/fixtures.ts`. Stores must implement a `reset()` method.
    *   **Mocking Rule:** Tests involving stores with side-effects (IDB, Supabase) **MUST** use `jest.doMock` and `require` inside `beforeEach` to ensure strict isolation and prevent module hoisting issues.
*   **RPC Integration (Jest):** Critical business logic in Postgres is verified via `lib/services/__tests__/supabase-rpc.test.ts`. These tests require valid credentials and run against live data in CI.
*   **E2E (Playwright):**
    *   **Runtime Audit:** `e2e/runtime-audit.spec.ts` verifies session persistence and hydration health on the live server.
    *   **Synchronization:** Never use `waitForTimeout`. Use `waitForResponse` for network-bound actions or assert on logical UI states (e.g., absence of spinners).
    *   **Visual Regression:** Screenshots are maintained for Chromium. Use `--update-snapshots` only for intentional UI changes.
        *   **Ghost Tiles:** Map backgrounds are mocked with static PNGs in `e2e/utils.ts` for visual stability.
        *   **Self-Cleaning:** Tests must delete created trips/users in `afterEach`. `deleteTestUser` utility is enhanced to recursively purge Supabase Storage files associated with the user to prevent bucket bloat.
        *   **Accessibility:** Every major view is scanned using `@axe-core/playwright`.
### 5. ID System (Strict Typing)
To prevent "Dual-ID" confusion, we use branded types in `lib/types.ts`:
*   **`GooglePlaceId` (string):** Used for API lookups and Map markers.
*   **`WineryDbId` (number):** The Supabase Primary Key. Used for relational data.
*   **Rule:** Always cast explicit IDs to these types. Never assume `string | number`.

### 6. Optimistic Updates Strategy
We use a comprehensive optimistic update strategy to ensure UI responsiveness.
*   **Pattern:** Update Zustand store immediately -> Call API/RPC -> Revert store on error -> (Optional) Refetch/Confirm on success.
*   **Offline Handling:** When offline, the "API/RPC" step is replaced by "Add to Offline Queue", and the optimistic update persists.

### 7. Navigation & Map Context Logic
*   **Active Trip (`selectedTrip`):**
    *   **Activation:** Occurs when a user selects a trip from the dropdown on the Map controls OR clicks the "On Trip" badge in a `WineryModal`.
    *   **Persistence:** This state is global (Zustand) and persists across client-side navigation.
    *   **Reset Rule:** To prevent the map from getting "stuck" on a trip, navigating to or away from a **Trip Details Page** (`/trips/[id]`) **MUST** explicitly clear the active trip (`setSelectedTrip(null)`).

### 8. Trips Tab Architecture
The Trips tab is consolidated into a single view managed by `TripList`.
*   **Happening Today:** Priority section for trips occurring on the current date.
*   **Upcoming:** Chronological list of future trips.
*   **Past:** Toggleable view for historical data.
*   **New Trip:** Integrated modal trigger in the header.

### 9. Friend Request Notifications
*   **Immediate Fetch:** Friend data, including pending requests, is fetched immediately upon user authentication to ensure notification badges are up-to-date.
*   **Notification Badges:** Visual indicators (red circles with counts) are displayed on the "Friends" tab.

## Key References (Maps & Tools)

### UI Architecture (Layout)
*   **Responsive Controller:** `AppShell` (`components/app-shell.tsx`) is the central orchestrator. It manages the state for switching between the **Desktop Sidebar** (`AppSidebar`) and the **Mobile Bottom Drawer** (`InteractiveBottomSheet`).
*   **Modals:** `WineryModal` and `VisitHistoryModal` are rendered at the root level in `AppShell` to prevent duplicate mounting and ARIA conflicts.

### Key Database RPCs (Power Tools)
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   `get_map_markers(user_id_param)`: Lightweight fetch for initial map load. Accepts explicit user ID to ensure flags (`is_favorite`) are correct.
    *   `get_winery_details_by_id(id)`: Lazy-loads full details (reviews, hours).
    *   `get_paginated_visits_with_winery_and_friends`: Fetches visit history efficiently.
    *   `get_trip_details(trip_id)`: Fetches full trip data including wineries and nested member visits in one call.
    *   `get_paginated_wineries(page, limit)`: Fetches wineries with user-specific flags and total count for browsing.
*   **Logic & Transactions:**
    *   `create_trip_with_winery`: Atomically creates a trip and adds the first winery.
    *   `add_winery_to_trip`: Handles upsert logic for wineries and additions to trips.
    *   `add_winery_to_trips`: Bulk adds a winery to multiple trips atomically.
    *   `reorder_trip_wineries`: Updates visit order for multiple wineries in a trip.
    *   `delete_trip`: Atomically deletes a trip and its winery relationships.
    *   `add_trip_member_by_email`: Securely adds a trip member using their email address.
    *   `update_trip_winery_notes`: Atomically updates notes for a specific winery within a trip.
    *   `log_visit`: Atomically creates/gets a winery and logs a new visit with photo array support.
    *   `update_visit`: Updates an existing visit and returns rich winery data.
    *   `delete_visit`: Securely deletes a visit record.
    *   `ensure_winery(p_winery_data)`: Security-definer RPC used to safely insert/get a winery ID, bypassing RLS `UPDATE` restrictions.
    *   `toggle_wishlist` / `toggle_favorite`: Atomic toggles for user winery lists.
*   **Social:**
    *   `send_friend_request(target_email)`: Securely look up user by email and create/revive friend requests.
    *   `respond_to_friend_request(requester_id, accept)`: Updates pending request status.
    *   `get_friends_activity_for_winery`: Returns JSON of friends who favorited/wishlisted a winery.

### Core Custom Hooks
*   **`useWineryMap`:** The "Brain" of the map view. Aggregates store data, handles map clicks, and manages the Google Maps instance.
*   **`useTripActions`:** Encapsulates trip-specific logic like "Export to Google Maps".

## Common Pitfalls & "Gotchas"

### 1. The Dual-ID System (Solved but Dangerous)
*   **Concept:** Wineries have `id` (Google String) and `dbId` (Supabase Integer).
*   **The Trap:** Mixing these up causes foreign key constraints to fail.
*   **The Fix:** Use `GooglePlaceId` and `WineryDbId` types. RPCs for *actions* (like adding a visit) usually require the `dbId`.

### 2. Derived State in Optimistic Updates
*   **Concept:** Zustand stores often have derived arrays (e.g., `trips` vs `tripsForDate`).
*   **The Trap:** Updating the "main" array (`trips`) during an optimistic update **does not** automatically re-compute the derived array (`tripsForDate`) if the logic is manual.
*   **The Fix:** When writing optimistic logic, update **all** relevant state arrays.

### 3. Testing Zustand with Mocks
*   **Concept:** We use `jest.mock` to bypass the actual Zustand store.
*   **The Trap:** Tests will crash if you add a new action to the Store but forget to add a mock implementation for it.
*   **The Fix:** Always check the `beforeEach` block in the test file.

### 4. Zustand Reactivity & `useMemo` Dependencies
*   **Concept:** When a Zustand store provides data through getter *functions* (e.g., `getWineries: () => useWineryDataStore.getState().persistentWineries`), the function reference itself remains stable.
*   **The Trap:** Including such a getter function in a `useMemo` dependency array (e.g., `[getWineries]`) will NOT cause `useMemo` to re-evaluate when the underlying data (`persistentWineries`) changes. The `useMemo` will only re-run if the *function reference* itself changes, which it typically does not. This leads to stale data being used by components.
*   **The Fix:** Always subscribe directly to the specific reactive state from the Zustand store you need. For example, instead of `const { getWineries } = useWineryStore();`, use `const persistentWineries = useWineryDataStore((state) => state.persistentWineries);` and include `persistentWineries` in your `useMemo` dependency array. This ensures components re-render when the data truly changes.

### 5. Map Lifecycle & `idle` Events in E2E
*   **Concept:** The winery list relies on the map's `idle` event to trigger initial search.
*   **The Trap:** In mocked E2E environments where map tiles are blocked, the `idle` event may not fire, resulting in an empty winery list.
*   **The Fix:** Use a manual "Search This Area" trigger in E2E tests to bypass the map's lifecycle dependency.

### 6. Radix UI & Pointer Events in Playwright Mobile
*   **Concept:** Radix UI primitives (like `TabsTrigger`) often rely on complex pointer event sequences (`pointerdown`, `mousedown`, `pointerup`, `mouseup`, `click`) to handle focus and state changes correctly.
*   **The Trap:** In Playwright mobile emulation (especially with touch enabled), a simple `page.click()` or `element.evaluate(el => el.click())` may fail to trigger the state change because it lacks the full event sequence Radix expects.
*   **The Fix:** Manually dispatch the full pointer event sequence using `element.dispatchEvent` in an `evaluate` block. See `e2e/helpers.ts` -> `navigateToTab` for the implementation.

### 7. Temporary IDs and Interaction Guards
*   **Concept:** Newly created trips use negative temporary IDs until saved to Supabase.
*   **The Trap:** Attempting to add wineries or modify members of a trip with a negative ID will fail at the database level.
*   **The Fix:** Components (like `TripCard`) must disable modification buttons (Edit, Add Member) when `trip.id < 0`.

### 8. Modal Scrolling Race Conditions
*   **Concept:** Hydrating visits after a modal opens can trigger "scroll to history" effects.
*   **The Trap:** Modals may jump to the middle or bottom during initial load.
*   **The Fix:** Use a `hasHydrated` ref to distinguish between initial data load and manual visit additions. Consolidate scroll resets into effects that fire only when `isLoading` is false.

### 9. ARIA Hidden Conflicts (Nesting)
*   **Concept:** Radix `Dialog` applies `aria-hidden` to siblings to enforce modality.
*   **The Trap:** Rendering multiple dialogs or nesting them inside components that are duplicated (like a mobile/desktop sidebar) causes "Blocked aria-hidden" warnings and focus loss.
*   **The Fix:** Render global modals (`WineryModal`, `VisitHistoryModal`) exactly once at the app root (`AppShell`). Decouple modal transitions with small `setTimeout` delays to allow one to start closing before the next opens.

### 10. A11y Scanning & Skeletons
*   **Concept:** Scanning a page while it's loading results in "Empty Heading" or "Missing Label" violations.
*   **The Fix:** E2E tests must wait for logical loading states (e.g., `svg.animate-spin`) to disappear before running `AxeBuilder.analyze()`.

### 11. Visual Regression & Engines
*   **Concept:** Different browser engines render fonts and borders with sub-pixel differences.
*   **The Fix:** Visual regression tests are restricted to `chromium`. Snapshots for Firefox/Webkit are not maintained to reduce overhead.

### 12. PWA Simulation in E2E
*   **Concept:** To test the PWA installation UI, we simulate the `beforeinstallprompt` browser event.
*   **The Trap:** If the event is dispatched without `{ cancelable: true }`, browser handlers (including the `usePwa` hook) may not correctly intercept it.
*   **The Fix:** Always dispatch with options: `new Event('beforeinstallprompt', { cancelable: true })`.

### 13. E2E Store Exposure
*   **Concept:** We use `E2EStoreExposer` to inject Zustand stores into the `window` object for testing.
*   **The Trap:** This component is gated behind `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. Running Playwright tests against a production build will cause `page.evaluate` calls accessing the stores to fail.
*   **The Fix:** Ensure the development server is running in `dev` mode (not `start`) during tests that require store access.

### 14. react-day-picker v9 API Changes
*   **Concept:** Version 9 introduces significant breaking changes to `classNames` and internal component structure.
*   **The Trap:** Legacy class names like `cell`, `day_selected`, and `nav_button` are removed or renamed.
*   **The Fix:** Use `month_grid` (for `table`), `day` (for `cell`), `day_button` (for the clickable element), `selected` (for `day_selected`), and `button_previous/next` (for navigation). Custom icons must now be passed via the `Chevron` component instead of `IconLeft/Right`.

### 15. E2E Selectors for react-day-picker v9
*   **Concept:** The "Today" marker (`data-today="true"`) and active styles (`bg-accent`) are now applied to the **parent `<td>` cell**, not the `<button>` element itself.
*   **The Trap:** Selectors like `button.bg-accent` or `button[aria-current="date"]` (if not explicitly passed) will fail to find the clickable element for "Today".
*   **The Fix:** Use a nested selector: `td[data-today="true"] button`.

### 16. Login Logic Complexity
*   **Concept:** The `login` helper in E2E tests should be simple and deterministic.
*   **The Trap:** Adding complex retry loops or `Promise.race` logic to handle "flakiness" often masks underlying issues (like incorrect selectors or network mocking) and leads to timeouts or detached DOM element errors.
*   **The Fix:** Rely on standard Playwright auto-waiting (`await page.fill`, `await page.click`). If a test is flaky, investigate the application state or test environment first.

## Future Implementations
*   **Mobile App:** The future desired state for the web application is to have both the web browser capability and an app deployed to mobile app stores. This necessitates ensuring that RPC functions are prioritized over API routes to ensure mobile application functionality. 

### Completed Refactors
1.  Architecture: Moved to "Supabase Native" for Trips. Removed API routes for Trips.
2.  Store Split: wineryStore.ts split into Data/UI stores.
3.  Optimization: Initial load only fetches markers. Visits are lazy-loaded.
4.  Testing: Implemented comprehensive Playwright E2E suite covering Auth, Trips, and Friends. Removed navigation workarounds after stabilizing hydration.
5.  Stability: Fixed critical hydration error in TripPlanner by implementing client-side mounting guards for date rendering, resolving mobile navigation state failures.
6.  UI Stability: Fixed DatePicker popover persistence in Tablet/Desktop viewports which was obstructing interactions (checkboxes/inputs) during E2E tests. Implemented controlled state to auto-close on selection.
7.  **Edit Visit Bug Fixed:** Resolved a bug where the 'Edit' button in the global history view failed to open the winery modal. Created migration `20251219132855_fix_get_paginated_visits_return_fields.sql` to add `google_place_id` to the RPC and refactored `VisitHistoryModal` for type safety.
8.  **E2E Test Suite Refactor & Stabilization:** 
    *   Centralized helpers in `e2e/helpers.ts` to ensure 100% consistency across `friends`, `trip`, and `visit` flows.
    *   Implemented robust mobile navigation: helpers now automatically handle expanding the `InteractiveBottomSheet` and account for animation delays.
    *   Resolved strict-mode violations by ensuring locators disambiguate between mobile and desktop UI instances.
9.  **Zero-Cost E2E Infrastructure:**
    *   Implemented a **Strict Blocking & Mocking** policy in `e2e/utils.ts`. 
    *   All costly Google Maps API requests (Places, Search, Details) are intercepted or aborted at the network level, ensuring **$0 API spend** during testing.
    *   **Ghost Tiles:** Map tile requests are fulfilled with transparent PNGs to maintain Map SDK functionality without hitting Google servers.
    *   **RPC Mocking:** The `get_map_markers` RPC is mocked to provide stable, name-agnostic data for testing.
    *   **Full Integrity Toggle:** Added `E2E_REAL_DATA=true` flag to bypass all mocks for periodic real-world verification.
10. **Test Environment Reliability:** Implemented automated cleanup of stale `.next` lock files and zombie `next dev` processes to resolve runner stalling issues.
11. **Hydration Error Fix:** Resolved a React hydration error in `WineryDetails.tsx` by replacing an invalid nested `DialogDescription` (rendered as `p`) with a standard `div`.
12. **Mobile Test Fixes:** Resolved `visit-flow` failures on mobile by implementing robust pointer event dispatching for Radix UI `TabsTrigger` in `e2e/helpers.ts`.
13. **Supabase Native Refactor (Visits):** Refactored `visitStore` and `VisitHistoryView` to use the Supabase SDK directly, eliminating dependency on `app/api/visits`.
14. Dead Code Removal:** Deleted obsolete `app/api/visits` directory and unused handlers in `app/api/friends`.
15. **v2.2.2 UX & Data Overhaul:**
    *   **Centralized Visit Management:** Unified visit state in a global store with cross-component optimistic updates.
    *   **Trips UI Refactor:** Consolidated trip views, removed legacy calendar, and implemented a mobile-optimized chronological layout.
    *   **Modal Stability:** Resolved race conditions in modal scrolling and ARIA hidden conflicts by moving modals to the app root and implementing hydration guards.
    *   **Type Safety:** Implemented `VisitWithWinery` type and resolved ID type mismatches in store mutations.
    *   **Hydration Fixes:** Ensured winery details are always fetched when opening modals from history or table views.
16. **React 19 / Next.js 16 Alignment:**
    *   **Type Safety:** Replaced deprecated `React.ElementRef` with `React.ComponentRef` across all UI components.
    *   **Context Refactor:** Updated `<Context.Provider>` to the new direct `<Context>` usage pattern.
    *   **Verification:** Validated changes with full TypeScript check and E2E test suite.
17. **Supabase Native Refactor (Friends):** Refactored friend request and response logic to use Supabase RPCs (`send_friend_request`, `respond_to_friend_request`), eliminating dependency on `app/api/friends`. Verified via multi-user E2E tests.
18. **Supabase Native Refactor (Wishlist & Favorites):** Refactored `toggleWishlist` and `toggleFavorite` logic to use Supabase RPCs (`toggle_wishlist`, `toggle_favorite`), streamlining database interactions and removing "Thick Server" logic from `app/actions.ts`. Verified with E2E tests.
19. **Supabase Native Refactor (Auth & Cleanup):** Eliminated redundant "wrapper" API routes (`/api/auth/me`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/wishlist`, `/api/wineries/[id]`) in favor of direct Supabase SDK usage on the client. Refactored `userStore.ts` and `SignupForm` to use the SDK directly. Cleaned up empty directories and updated `proxy.ts` middleware.
20. **Supabase Native Refactor (Trip Management):** Refactored `TripService.ts` to use atomic Supabase RPCs (`get_trip_details`, `create_trip_with_winery`, `add_winery_to_trips`, `reorder_trip_wineries`, `delete_trip`). Eliminated multi-step client-side merging logic and inefficient bulk inserts, ensuring atomic transactions and improved performance for trip planning and management.
21. **Postgres Security Patch:** Applied `SET search_path = public` to all `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC functions to resolve "Function Search Path Mutable" security warnings and prevent potential hijacking vulnerabilities. Verified via `npx supabase db lint`.
22. **Supabase Native Refactor (Winery Browsing):** Migrated the "Browse" list fetching from standard table select to `get_paginated_wineries` RPC. This move ensures the browsing view includes rich user-specific state (favorites, wishlist, visited) while improving backend performance.
23. **Supabase Native Refactor (Visit Mutations):** Refactored `visitStore.ts` to use atomic Supabase RPCs (`update_visit`, `delete_visit`). This eliminates redundant select calls after updates and ensures only authorized owners can delete visits through a secure database layer.
24. **Supabase Native Refactor (Trip Sharing & Notes):** Migrated trip member addition and winery note updates to RPCs (`add_trip_member_by_email`, `update_trip_winery_notes`). This enables secure, email-based trip sharing without exposing full profile lists and ensures atomic updates for winery-specific metadata.
25. **Mobile Interaction Fix:** Resolved a critical issue where the `InteractiveBottomSheet` blocked interactions with the map and bottom navigation tray on mobile devices after login. Applied conditional rendering to the sheet to ensure it is fully unmounted when closed.
26. **Testing Overhaul (v2.2.4):**
    *   **RPC Integration:** Implemented live database logic verification.
    *   **Visual Regression:** Established baseline snapshots with "Ghost Tiles" map mocking.
    *   **A11y Scanning:** Automated accessibility verification in CI.
    *   **State Isolation:** Enforced global store resets in Jest.
    *   **Standardized Fixtures:** Centralized all mock data factory functions.
    *   **Error Resilience:** Verified UI behavior for server/network failures.
27. **PWA & Search Optimization (v2.2.5):**
    *   **Progressive Web App:** Enabled full PWA support with installability, offline caching, and service worker strategies via `@serwist/next`.
    *   **Search Caching:** Implemented Supabase-backed caching for Google Places API searches to reduce costs and improve performance.
    *   **Smart Zoom:** Added logic to force re-search when zooming into clusters.
    *   **Dynamic Hours:** Added real-time "Open/Closed" status calculation.
28. **Accessibility & UX Polish (Post-v2.2.5):**
    *   **Contrast Fixes:** Updated login links to use darker blue (`text-blue-800`) and permanent underlines for WCAG compliance.
    *   **Form Feedback:** Added `aria-live="polite"` to form validation messages and `role="alert"` to friend request errors for screen reader announcements.
    *   **Empty State CTA:** Added a "Browse Wineries" button to the Trips tab when no trips exist, linking directly to the Explore view.
29. **Parallel Photo Uploads:** Refactored `visitStore.ts` to implement a parallel upload strategy for visit photos using optimistic updates with 'blob:' URLs, backed by Supabase Storage and an atomic `log_visit` RPC. This replaces the previous multi-step update process with a more robust and faster atomic transaction.
30. **Photo Management E2E Coverage:** Implemented `e2e/photo-flow.spec.ts` for real-world integration testing of the photo lifecycle (add/verify/delete) within the storage and database loop. Enhanced `deleteTestUser` utility in `e2e/utils.ts` to perform recursive storage cleanup, ensuring tests leave zero orphaned artifacts in the Supabase bucket.
31. **Supabase Edge Function Migration:** Migrated the Google Places detail proxy from a Next.js API route to a **Supabase Edge Function** (`get-winery-details`). This ensures backend compatibility with mobile Bearer Tokens and strictly adheres to the "Supabase Native" architecture.
32. **Middleware Security Fix:** Updated `proxy.ts` matcher to explicitly include `/api/` routes, closing a security gap where API authentication checks were being bypassed.
33. **Type Safety & Maintainability:** Implemented manual `database.types.ts` and refactored stores into separate Data and UI layers (`wineryDataStore.ts` vs `wineryStore.ts`), eliminating `any` types and improving code legibility.
34. **Robust PWA & Offline Support:**
    *   **Offline Queue:** Implemented a mutation queue using IndexedDB (`idb-keyval`) to support creating, editing, and deleting visits while offline.
    *   **Background Sync:** Added `syncOfflineVisits` to automatically replay queued mutations upon reconnection.
    *   **Store Persistence:** Enabled `persist` middleware for all major stores (`wineryDataStore`, `tripStore`, `visitStore`) to ensure instant hydration in offline mode.
    *   **Hydration Fix:** Refactored `wineryDataStore` to merge incoming map markers with existing detailed data, preventing data loss during refresh.
    *   **Fallback UI:** Implemented `/~offline` page and a translucent `OfflineIndicator` banner for enhanced user feedback.
35. **Data Consistency & Recovery:**
    *   **Ghost Status Fix:** Updated `standardizeWineryData` to forcibly clear local `visits` if the server reports `user_visited: false`, ensuring pins correctly revert to "New" status.
    *   **Cache Recovery:** Enhanced `ensureWineryDetails` to bypass the local cache and force a fresh fetch if a winery is marked as visited but has zero visits locally. This resolves "Hidden Visit" bugs for existing stale caches.
    *   **Debug Tools:** Implemented a "Hard Reset Cache" tool on the `/debug` page to allow manual purging of local data stores in extreme sync failure scenarios.
    *   **Type Safety:** Relaxed RPC type guards to handle optional `trip_info` fields, ensuring consistent data merging across different API versions.
36. **PWA Reliability (iOS Offline Cold Start):** Switched the Service Worker caching strategy for documents (pages) from `NetworkFirst` to `StaleWhileRevalidate` with a 30-day expiration. This resolves a critical issue on iOS where the app would fail to open from a cold start in "lie-fi" or offline conditions.
37. **Fixed "Want to Go" 404 (Schema Drift):** Resolved a critical bug where the `toggle_wishlist` RPC was missing from the remote database despite having a migration file. Manually re-applied the SQL with `SECURITY DEFINER` and `SET search_path = public` to restore functionality.
38. **PWA Storage Reliability:** Fixed `QuotaExceededError` in the Service Worker by reducing the `google-maps-tiles` cache limit from 1000 to 200 items and enabling `purgeOnQuotaError`. This prevents the browser cache from filling up with map tiles.
39. **Social Activity Feed:** Implemented the frontend for the Friend Activity Feed (`FriendActivityFeed.tsx`) and integrated it into the Friends Manager. Added `fetchFriendActivityFeed` to `friendStore.ts` and defined the RPC type in `database.types.ts`.
40. **Mobile Navigation Polish:** Improved mobile UX by removing redundant tabs from the `InteractiveBottomSheet` and adding a dedicated "History" button to the mobile bottom navigation bar in `app-shell.tsx`.
41. **E2E Fix (Mobile & Social):** Updated `navigateToTab` helper to correctly target the 'History' button in the mobile bottom bar (aligning with v2.2.5 UI changes) and patched `social-feed.spec.ts` to use real DB reads for visit history, ensuring data consistency in hybrid tests.
42. **PWA v2 - Offline Robustness & Rich Install:**
    *   **Offline Images:** Added `sw.ts` caching rule for Supabase Storage images, ensuring photos load offline.
    *   **Non-Blocking Errors:** Updated `wineryDataStore` and `tripStore` to suppress network errors when cached data is available, allowing navigation in "Lie-Fi" conditions.
    *   **Mutation Queue:** Enhanced `visitStore` to automatically queue mutations (save/edit/delete) on network timeout/failure, preserving the optimistic UI update.
    *   **Rich Manifest:** Added screenshots and shortcuts to `site.webmanifest` for an App Store-like install card.
    *   **Install/Update UI:** Implemented `PwaHandler` (with loop fix) to show custom, non-intrusive "Install App" and "Update Available" notifications (Desktop: Bottom-Left Card, Mobile: Slim Top Banner).
    *   **Mobile Layout:** Condensed `CookieConsent` to a slim bottom bar on mobile to prevent obstruction of login links.
    *   **Stale-While-Revalidate:** Switched Service Worker strategy for document shell to resolve iOS offline startup issues.
43. **Social Activity Feed:** Implemented real-time friend activity tracking, signed private photos, and empty state prompts.
44. CI/Test Stabilization:
    *   **Store Exposure:** Implemented `E2EStoreExposer` to safely inject/read Zustand state during tests via `window`.
    *   **Mobile Robustness:** Fixed PWA tests to handle bottom sheet navigation and responsive visibility.
    *   **Error Overlays:** Added forced CSS injection to hide Next.js error overlays in CI.
45. **Tailwind CSS v4 Migration:**
    *   **Framework Upgrade:** Migrated from Tailwind v3 to v4 using `@tailwindcss/upgrade`.
    *   **CSS-Native Config:** Moved theme configuration and plugin integration (e.g., `tailwindcss-animate`) to `app/globals.css`.
    *   **PostCSS v4:** Switched to `@tailwindcss/postcss` for standard build integration.
46. **Mobile Layout Optimization (v2.2.9):**
    *   **PWA Install Prompt:** Refactored into a slim full-width top bar on mobile with a dismiss button.
    *   **Cookie Consent:** Refactored into a slim full-width bottom bar on mobile.
    *   **Desktop Layout:** Positioned PWA card at bottom-left and Cookie card at bottom-right for zero overlap.
    *   **Verification:** Added `e2e/pwa-install-layout.spec.ts` to ensure layout stability across viewports.
47. **PWA Install/Update Menu Refactor:**
    *   **User Menu Integration:** Refactored PWA controls into the user avatar dropdown menu for both Desktop (Sidebar) and Mobile (Floating Header).
    *   **Always-On Logic:** Implemented "Smart Install" logic that remains visible in browsers even when native prompts are unavailable.
    *   **Dynamic Labels:** Conditional button text switches between "Install App" (native) and "Add to Home Screen" (manual) based on browser state.
    *   **Standalone Detection:** Enhanced `usePwa` hook to detect existing installations and hide redundant controls.
    *   **UX Consistency:** Reverted to Lucide iconography (`Download`, `RefreshCw`) for visual alignment with the system design language.
48. **Tailwind v4 Optimization & Polish:**
    *   **Container Queries:** Refactored `responsive-table` utility to use modern `@container` queries, ensuring robust responsiveness in nested layouts (sidebar/cards) regardless of viewport width.
    *   **Field Sizing:** Implemented `field-sizing-content` in `Textarea` component, enabling native automatic height adjustment without JavaScript.
    *   **Configuration Cleanup:** Removed legacy `border-color` compatibility shims from `globals.css` and updated `components.json` to reflect the removal of `tailwind.config.ts`.
    *   **Visual Baseline:** Updated E2E visual regression snapshots to align with the new v4 rendering engine.
49. **Major Library Upgrade (v2.3.0):**
    *   **Date Utilities:** Migrated to `react-day-picker` v9 and `date-fns` v4.
    *   **Calendar Refactor:** Fully refactored `Calendar` component to the v9 API, fixing mobile alignment and desktop navigation overlap.
    *   **Stability Fixes:** Resolved infinite render loops in `PwaHandler` and `useToast` by stabilizing callbacks and using `useRef` for effect guards.
50. **Type Safety (Supabase Utilities):** Resolved implicit 'any' errors in `utils/supabase/server.ts` and `admin.ts` by explicitly typing the `setAll` cookie signature for compatibility with latest `@supabase/ssr` versions.
51. **CI Sharding & Parallelization**: Implemented 4-way parallel sharding in GitHub Actions, significantly reducing test suite execution time. Optimized for stability by limiting each CI shard to a single worker to prevent backend resource contention on the dev server.
52. **PWA Production Audit**: Implemented a dedicated CI job (`test-pwa`) that builds the app and runs high-fidelity tests against a production server (`npm run start`). This verifies real-world Service Worker behavior, offline sync, and manifest validity.
53. **Safe Store Exposure**: Introduced the `IS_E2E` environment variable to conditionally mount the `E2EStoreExposer` even in production builds, ensuring tests can still inject state while keeping the live production site clean.
54. **UI-Based PWA Testing**: Refactored PWA spec files to use real UI interactions (searching/clicking markers) instead of store injection, ensuring that offline and sync features are verified through the actual user journey.
55. **Test Stability & Resilience**: Enhanced E2E reliability with deterministic `waitForResponse` synchronization in the `login` helper and added stability buffers for IndexedDB background writes. Refactored `mockGoogleMapsApi` with a selective exclusion mechanism to allow tests to override global mocks for error-handling scenarios.
56. **Fixture-Based E2E Architecture**: Refactored the entire E2E suite to use Playwright fixtures (`mockMaps`, `user`). Introduced `MockMapsManager` to centralize API mocking and `user` fixture to automate lifecycle and storage cleanup.
57. **Deterministic Waits Expansion**: Replaced all remaining arbitrary timeouts in core flows with `page.waitForResponse` targeting specific Supabase RPC and REST endpoints.
58. **Black-Box Social Verification**: Updated `wishlist-flow` and `photo-flow` to rely entirely on UI state (colors, labels, image sources) rather than direct Zustand store inspection.
59. **Mobile Navigation Robustness**: Implemented a hybrid pointer event sequence (`pointerdown` -> `mousedown` -> `click`) in `navigateToTab` to resolve flaky Radix UI interactions in mobile emulation.
60. **Modern Google Maps Mocking**: Implemented robust mocks for the "New" Google Places API (`searchByText`) and `Geocoder` via `addInitScript` to prevent real API contamination during tests.
61. **CI Optimization**: Implemented browser and npm caching in GitHub Actions, reducing setup time from 10+ minutes to <30 seconds per run. Optimized sharding strategy to target specific browser engines for stability.
62. **Stateful Trip Mocking**: Implemented an in-memory stateful mock for the Supabase `/trips` REST API and related RPCs in `e2e/utils.ts`. This ensures deterministic testing of create/rename/delete flows without database race conditions or eventual consistency delays.
63. **Accessibility Fix**: Refactored `InteractiveBottomSheet` to resolve a critical "Nested Interactive Controls" violation by moving the close button outside the toggle area.
64. **PWA Test Infrastructure Refactor**: Migrated E2E mocking to `page.context().route()` and implemented strict `Cache-Control: no-store` headers for all Supabase mock responses. This ensures 100% reliable request interception in production builds with active Service Workers, resolving the long-standing `trip-flow` failure in the PWA audit suite.
65. **Auth Recovery & Deep Linking**: Implemented forgot/reset password flow and a `redirectTo` middleware pattern to preserve user destination during authentication. Verified with new E2E suites.
66. **DatePicker UX Verification**: Added responsive E2E tests for the `react-day-picker` v9 integration, ensuring correct component selection (Popover vs Drawer) and state management.
67. **WebKit/Safari CI Stabilization**: Resolved cross-browser flakiness by exporting `dismissErrorOverlay`, implementing deterministic network waits for manual login steps, and using ARIA-filtered selectors to avoid conflicts with Next.js internal route announcer.
68. **Containerized E2E Infrastructure**: Implemented `scripts/run-e2e-container.sh` for rootless Podman testing on RHEL 8, enabling local verification of WebKit and Firefox tests with CI parity.
69. **E2E Stability Overhaul**: Implemented robust `dispatchEvent` clicks and scoped sidebar locators to resolve mobile clipping and strict-mode violations.
70. **WebKit E2E Mock Stabilization**: Implemented a global Service Worker registration block in `MockMapsManager` and `clearServiceWorkers` helper. This ensures that mock responses for Supabase RPCs and Google Maps are never bypassed by the Service Worker cache in WebKit/Safari, achieving 100% test reliability across all browser engines.

### 4. Security & Quality Control
*   **Database Linting:** We use `npx supabase db lint` to enforce Postgres security best practices (e.g., `search_path` security). This check is **required** to pass in CI before any migration can be merged.
*   **Search Path Security:** All `SECURITY DEFINER` functions **must** explicitly set `SET search_path = public` to prevent schema hijacking vulnerabilities.

## End-to-End Testing (Playwright)

We have established a robust E2E testing infrastructure using **Playwright**.

### 1. Key Test Suites (`e2e/`)
*   **`smoke.spec.ts`:** Verifies basic app health, routing, and auth redirection.
*   **`trip-flow.spec.ts`:** Tests the core "Trip Planning" value loop.
*   **`visit-flow.spec.ts`:** Tests visit logging, editing, and deletion (name-agnostic).
*   **`photo-flow.spec.ts`:** Tests the full lifecycle of photo management (add, verify, delete).
*   **`friends-flow.spec.ts`:** Tests complex **Multi-User / Real-Time** interactions using two distinct browser contexts.
*   **`runtime-audit.spec.ts`:** Performs deep runtime verification of hydration health and session persistence on the live dev server.
*   **`pwa-offline.spec.ts`:** Verifies offline capabilities including navigation cache, offline indicator, and mutation queueing logic.
*   **`pwa-assets.spec.ts`:** Verifies manifest validity, install prompt triggers, and asset caching/syncing.

### 2. Containerized Local Testing (RHEL 8)
Since RHEL 8 lacks system dependencies for WebKit and Firefox, we use a rootless Podman container for local parity with CI.
*   **Command:** `./scripts/run-e2e-container.sh webkit`
*   **Network:** Uses `--network=host` to connect to the host's PM2 server on port 3001.
*   **Security:** Uses `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined` to allow Ubuntu-based library relocation.

### 3. Best Practices & Stability
*   **Scoping:** Always use `getSidebarContainer(page)` to target the correct sidebar, as both mobile and desktop versions exist in the DOM.
*   **Robust Clicks:** Use `locator.evaluate(el => el.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', { bubbles: true })))` for elements that might be clipped by mobile sheets or animations.
*   **Deterministic Waits:** 
    *   Use `page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after significant navigations.
    *   Use `waitForMapReady(page)` helper to ensure the map and bounds are initialized in the store.
*   **Mobile Navigation:** To trigger Radix UI components on mobile, use the robust pointer event sequence implemented in `navigateToTab`.
*   **Store Exposure:** We use `components/e2e-store-exposer.tsx` to expose internal Zustand stores to `window` (only in dev/test) for precise state injection and verification if absolutely necessary, but UI-based testing is preferred.
*   **Mobile Safari (WebKit) Stability:**
    *   **Login:** Use `page.keyboard.press('Enter')` instead of clicking the "Sign In" button, which can be flaky in WebKit.
    *   **Assertions:** Use mobile-aware assertions (e.g., checking for the bottom navigation bar `div.fixed.bottom-0`) to verify successful login on small screens.
*   **Idempotency:** Tests are self-cleaning via the `user` fixture.
*   **Hydration Awareness:** The `login` helper explicitly waits for the `AuthProvider` "Loading..." screen to disappear and for network stability.
*   **PWA Mocking:** For tests targeting production builds or PWAs, always use `page.context().route()` instead of `page.route()`. This ensures that network requests initiated by the Service Worker are correctly intercepted. Additionally, always include `Cache-Control: no-store` in mock headers to prevent Service Worker caching.
*   **Zero-Cost Mocking:** The `MockMapsManager` in `e2e/utils.ts` handles both Google Maps and Supabase Data API mocking. It uses a stateful in-memory array for Trips to mimic database behavior without network latency.

### 4. Execution Scripts
*   **Zero-Cost (Daily):** `npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium` (Mocks Google/Supabase Reads)
*   **Full Integrity (Monthly):** `npm run test:e2e:real -- --project=chromium` (Uses real Google/Supabase data)
*   **Manual Runner:**
    ```bash
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" && npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium
    ```
