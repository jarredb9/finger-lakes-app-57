# Project: Winery Vist Planner and Tracker Web App

## General Instructions:
- Always be entirely netural in your responses
- Rather than guess at an error solution, include any necessary console logs to troubleshoot the issue properly
- Never change the caching stragety for the application
- The application is deployed to a remote Vercel server and does not have a local installation

## Always consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices for React, Next.js, Zustand Stores, Supabase, Google Maps API, and general web application development
