# Project: Winery Vist Planner and Tracker Web App

## General Instructions:
- Always be entirely netural in your responses
- Rather than guess at an error solution, include any necessary console logs to troubleshoot the issue properly
- Never change the caching stragety for the application
- The application is deployed to a remote Vercel server and does not have a local installation
- When trying to run npm commands you must first run "export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" to run npm from the correct location

## Database Management (Supabase):
- **Source of Truth:** The `supabase/migrations` folder is the single source of truth for the database schema. Do not manually edit the database via the Supabase Dashboard or `scripts/consolidated-schema.sql`.
- **Environment:** Database operations are performed in GitHub Codespaces using the Supabase CLI.
- **Workflow:**
  1.  **Create Migration:** Run `npx supabase migration new <description_of_change>` to generate a new timestamped SQL file.
  2.  **Edit SQL:** Write the specific SQL changes (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER POLICY`) in the generated file.
  3.  **Deploy:** Run `npx supabase db push` to apply the changes to the remote database.

## Always consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices for React, Next.js, Zustand Stores, Supabase, Google Maps API, and general web application development
